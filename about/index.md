# short bio
For you not leaving with empty pockets here's a mini-bio of [mini-me](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holz-Tiger).

In terms of tools evolution where everybody's used to graphical interfaces I prefer going 3 steps back: extensively using the console and other simple tools, that's why I decided some years ago moving to Linux and never going back again to M$ Windows:
- personal skills:
  - fluent in German and English
  - passionate(!) in work and life
  - curious(!) like a kid
  - enabling people, projects
- experiences
  - ceo, cto, and founder of and for some companys
  - ScrumMaster, PM, PL
  - trainer, coach, presenter
- IT skills
  - Java, Scala (I just luv FP!), Web
  - git (especially on the console)
  - bash
  - Ubuntu

... there's more, but sorry headhunters you'll find other sources ;)

# Digital

You might find me under different names like: Mr. T and [Taj-My-Tai](https://www.instagram.com/taj.my.tai/)...
- and if you dig deeper back to the late [90s](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Sex-im-Web-nur-noch-auf-Platz-3-15234.html), 80s, where...
  - kids did conventional activities like soccer or whatever,
  - computers weren't mainstream and part of our daily life
- ... you'll find me in the [C64/Brotkasten](http://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/black-panther/credits) scene as well.

# Personal
Since beginning of 2017 I'm back in my lovely hometown, [Freiburg im Breisgau, South Germany, Black Forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau). Cooking and eating are more than a passion for me. I rather spent cutting something then wasting my time in front of 'dada-gaga-television'. My unit of measure of a good weekend is simple: dancing on beautiful, electronic music >= one night per weekend

... and I plan doing more sports activities like running, bouldering, and basketball would be also gr8.
