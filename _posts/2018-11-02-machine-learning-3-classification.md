Objective of this post is understanding:
- Principles and Usage of Classifications
- Important methods of classifications, for later practical usage

[Pruning (decision trees)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_(decision_trees)):
> Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.
